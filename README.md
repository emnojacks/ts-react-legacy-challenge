# React Typescript Fetch Challenge 

This was a project for Eleven Fifty Academy's Red Badge.  

## Project Requirements

Using typescript, create a class component and a functional component. The class component should reach out to the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to grab your coordinates. Then using those coordinates, reach out to the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and retrieve the weather information for your area.  Once you have the weather, it should be sent to the functional component to be displayed. 

## Languages used:

- JavaScript
- React / JSX
